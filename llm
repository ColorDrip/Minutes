System: * The user's request has been cut off. Based on the context, it seems they were asking about a better way to create an FAQ chatbot that can handle question-answer pairs efficiently, avoiding issues like the `cudart64_110.dll` error. I'll assume the rest of the request was about completing the setup for such a chatbot.

### Completing the FAQ Chatbot Script
The script below continues from the previous response, implementing a full FAQ chatbot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach with `sentence-transformers` for embedding, `faiss` for retrieval, and a lightweight question-answering model for validation. This runs on CPU to avoid CUDA-related errors and is optimized for FAQ-style question-answer pairs.

```python
import json
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import faiss
import numpy as np
from transformers import pipeline

# Load FAQs (replace with your data or file)
faqs = [
    {"question": "What is the capital of France?", "answer": "The capital of France is Paris."},
    {"question": "How do I reset my password?", "answer": "Go to the login page, click 'Forgot Password,' and follow the instructions."},
    {"question": "What are the store hours?", "answer": "The store is open from 9 AM to 6 PM, Monday to Saturday."},
    # Add more Q&A pairs here
]

# Alternatively, load from a JSON file
# with open("faqs.json", "r") as f:
#     faqs = json.load(f)

# Initialize models
embedder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')  # Small, CPU-friendly embedding model
qa_pipeline = pipeline("question-answering", model="distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad", device=-1)  # Force CPU

# Create FAISS index for FAQ questions
faq_questions = [faq["question"] for faq in faqs]
faq_embeddings = embedder.encode(faq_questions, convert_to_tensor=True).cpu().numpy()
dimension = faq_embeddings.shape[1]
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)
index.add(faq_embeddings)

# Function to find the most relevant FAQ and validate the answer
def answer_question(user_question, top_k=1, confidence_threshold=0.5):
    # Embed the user's question
    question_embedding = embedder.encode([user_question], convert_to_tensor=True).cpu().numpy()
    
    # Search for the closest FAQ question
    distances, indices = index.search(question_embedding, top_k)
    best_index = indices[0][0]
    best_question = faq_questions[best_index]
    best_answer = faqs[best_index]["answer"]
    confidence = 1 / (1 + distances[0][0])  # Convert distance to similarity score (rough estimate)

    # Validate with QA model
    qa_result = qa_pipeline(question=user_question, context=best_answer)
    if qa_result['score'] > confidence_threshold:
        return qa_result['answer'], qa_result['score']
    else:
        return "I couldn't find a confident answer. Please try rephrasing your question.", 0.0
