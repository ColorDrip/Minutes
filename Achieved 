1. Key Achievements & Milestones Delivered
Achieved efficiency gains against a 5% target of team capacity, through focused automation initiatives.
33 automation ideas implemented during the year, addressing critical process gaps and enabling better visibility.
At the beginning of the year, there was a lack of transparency on target setting and capacity utilization due to the absence of a centralized pipeline. With strong management support and regular feedback, the BB Tool was successfully implemented to resolve this challenge.
Developed and implemented a Dashboard Solution to track time spent per activity, improving transparency and resource allocation.
Extended automation capabilities by piloting new use cases. One use case has been successfully implemented, a second is currently in UAT stage, and a third is in field-forward planning.
Initiated Automation Spitting (automation pipeline splitting) to create a structured funnel of automation opportunities, ensuring scalability for the upcoming year.
2. Quantitative Data / Metrics
33 use cases delivered across various teams and functions.
Efficiency gains aligned to 5% of total team capacity.
500+ hours projected savings identified for next year through the automation pipeline.
1 live use case, 1 in UAT, and 1 in pipeline, ensuring continuity of delivery momentum.
3. Impact Created
Quantitative:
Increased transparency of effort allocation through the BB Tool and Dashboard, enabling data-driven decision-making.
Better resource utilization tracking, helping in prioritization and capacity planning.
Identified and locked in future savings potential of 500+ hours.
Qualitative:
Shifted the team from a manual, opaque process to a centralized, insight-driven way of working.
Enhanced collaboration between teams by bringing all use cases and time data into a single view, enabling smoother discussions and planning.
Improved stakeholder confidence through real-time visibility and structured governance.
4. Notable Collaborations, Innovations & Success Stories
Close partnership between team leads, automation champions (e.g., Rohan and John), and central governance enabled rapid adoption of tools like Power Automate.
With A-to-A pillar support, initiated the development of Chatbot Assistance Spot, trained on process data, to support end users effectively.
The BB Tool implementation itself is a strong example of collaboration between business teams and management to solve a persistent transparency gap.
The team has set a foundation for next yearâ€™s pipeline, ensuring scalability and innovation through structured use case selection.
