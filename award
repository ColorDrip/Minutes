Award Nomination: Excellence in Automation, Innovation, and Leadership
I would like to nominate Anil Khambadkar for the Annual Achievement Award in recognition of his outstanding contribution to automation, analytics, and team enablement over the past year.
Anil played a pivotal role in building and scaling a robust automation ecosystem by combining data analytics, AI-driven solutions, and Power Platform capabilities. Under his leadership and technical guidance, 30+ automation initiatives, including multiple approved change requests, were successfully delivered, resulting in approximately 2,015 hours of effort saved in the last year. These initiatives directly improved operational efficiency, transparency, and turnaround time across processes.
One of Anil’s key achievements was the design and deployment of an intelligent chatbot, developed as a productivity and decision-support tool rather than a simple Q&A solution. In parallel, he led and contributed hands-on to several end-to-end automations using Power Automate and Power Apps, ensuring solutions were scalable, governed, and aligned with business needs.
Beyond delivered solutions, Anil demonstrated strong forward-thinking innovation by driving future-ready use cases, including a license plate detection model using computer vision and machine learning. This initiative reflects his ability to identify emerging opportunities and translate them into practical automation roadmaps.
Anil also developed in-house financial forecasting models, embedded within depository systems, enabling data-driven planning and decision-making. These models were fully conceptualized, built, and operationalized internally, highlighting his strong analytical depth and ownership.
Equally noteworthy is Anil’s leadership and collaboration. He consistently mentored and guided the automation team, providing hands-on technical support, architectural direction, and continuous learning opportunities. His support spanned chatbot development, Power Automate workflows, MS Access–based systems, system integrations, dashboards, and analytics. Through this approach, he not only ensured successful delivery but also uplifted the technical capability and confidence of the team.
Anil’s ability to collaborate effectively with stakeholders, align solutions to business priorities, and foster a culture of innovation and ownership has been instrumental to the success of the automation program. His contributions reflect a rare blend of technical excellence, people leadership, and strategic vision, making him a strong and deserving candidate for this award.
If you want, I can:
Make it shorter (some awards allow only 200–300 words)
Rewrite it in third-person / first-person as per form requirement
Add a strong one-line impact headline
Tailor it for a specific award category (Innovation, Leadership, Digital Transformation)
This is a solid, award-worthy story — proud moment material 👏
